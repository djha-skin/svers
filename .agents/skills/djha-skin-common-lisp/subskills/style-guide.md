# Style Guide

Please note the following style guidelines:

* We use full-name reverse-DNS semantics to name ASDF systems

* There should at least be a `src/main.lisp` and a `tests/main.lisp` file
  present.

* License is MIT.

* We use the parachute library for tests.

* We call each test package on `(asdf:test-system
  "com.djhaskin.<name-of-the-repository>")`.

* Uninterned keyword symbols are preferred when naming and pulling in
  packages within a `defpackage` form; interned keywords are used as directives
  within `defpackage` (`:use`, `:import-from`, etc.)

* We use full-name, reverse-DNS semantics to name packages, and the `main.lisp`
  file's package should match that of the whole system

* Each file gets its own subpackage

* Each dependency within a `defpackage` form gets its own `(:import-from)`
  statement which doesn't actually list any symbols from that package. This is
  solely to tell ASDF that they are dependencies of this package.

* Local nicknames in `defpackage` and throughout the source are heavily used,
  including to remove all the reverse-DNS prefixes of in-system package
  dependencies

* Files should all begin with file beginner comment lines, prefixed with four
  semi-colons (`;;;;`).

* Comments above top-level definitions (`defun`, `defparameter`, etc.) hould
  start with three semi-colons (`;;;`).

* Comments on their own line should start with two semi-colons (`;;`).

* Comments sharing a line with code should start with one, or a single
  semi-colon (`;`).

* All the same conventions apply to test code (under the `tests/` folder) as
  main code (under the `src/` folder).

* Parachute within test code `defpackage` forms in particular should have an
  `import-from` but SHOULD name the symbols we use, contrary to the usual
  convention outlined in this guide.

* Only 80 characters per line, please, for any text-based file in the
  repository. Wrap intelligently if you must to follow this rule.

* Use `ros fmt <file>` to format Lisp source files. It handles consistent
  indentation automatically. Run `ros fmt` on all source files before
  committing.

* Use `cl-mcp` MCP server for ALL Lisp operations — loading systems, running
  tests, editing forms, checking parens, code search. Do NOT use one-off `sbcl`
  or `ros` commands. The cl-mcp server manages the Lisp image and provides
  structure-aware tools (`lisp-edit-form`, `lisp-patch-form`, `lisp-read-file`,
  `repl-eval`, `run-tests`, `lisp-check-parens`, `code-find`, `code-describe`,
  `code-find-references`).

* Use **OCICL** for package management, NOT Qlot or Quicklisp (`ql:quickload`).
  OCICL packages systems as OCI-compliant artifacts distributed via container
  registries. Systems are project-local by default.

  * `ocicl install` — install all systems from `ocicl.csv`
  * `ocicl install <system>` — install a specific system
  * `ocicl list <system>` — see available versions
  * `ocicl latest` — update all systems to latest
  * `ocicl setup` — install ocicl-runtime and configure your Lisp init file
  * `ocicl lint <path>` — lint Common Lisp files

  The `ocicl.csv` file in the project root tracks which systems and versions
  are used. Commit it to version control; never commit the `ocicl/` directory
  (which contains downloaded system code).

* No trailing whitespace, ever.

* Keep a changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` in the root folder. For each version bump,
  track what was changed, fixed, and added.
